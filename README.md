# Placozoa tracking

This project is about a [placozoa] that has been cut in its center.

# Getting started

## Installing the dependencies
To install Python and the required dependencies we strongly recommend to use
[conda], [mamba] or [pipenv].

## Installing conda

Conda can be installed multiple ways. There is no recommendations about how to
but one can read [there](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
for a likely exhaustive list on ways to install conda.

Note that Anaconda is not necessarily recommended, [miniconda] might be a better
alternative.

Moreover, it is advised to start jupyter notebooks from a shell/terminal/prompt
to be able to better see the error messages.

## Installing the dependencies

Once conda is installed (or your favorite environment manager), you can create
and activate your environment:
```shell
conda create -n placozoa
conda activate placozoa
```

Then, there is a `setup.py` file with the basic dependencies present within this
repository. It means that you can easily install all the likely necessary
dependencies using [pip]. It might be necessary to install it first:
```shell
conda install pip
```

Then, it is possible to install the dependencies, from the placozoa-tracking
folder the following way:
```shell
pip install .
```

### List of dependencies:
Here is the list of dependencies that will be installed:
- [numpy] : basic library for array manipulation
- [matplotlib] : basic library to plot figures
- [scipy] : one of the basic libraries for image analysis (`ndimage`)
- [scikit-image] : one of the basic libraries for image analysis
- [scikit-learn] : one of the basic libraries for data analysis
- [tifffile] : library to read and write tiff images
- [ipython] : interactive python terminal
- [jupyter] : python notebook
- [napari] : 3D image visualizer

# Road Map

# Problems that this software is trying to solve
Understanding better Placozoans wound healing

# Objectives
The objectives are likely in order of difficulty but they can be done in any.

It is not expected, whatsoever, for all the objectives to be completed.

- Detecting and tracking the placozoan throughout the whole movie #2
- Quantitatively characterising the shape of the placozoan over time #3
- Detecting and tracking the wound throughout the whole movie #4
- Quantitatively characterising the shape of the wound over time #5
- Building a napari plugin for the detection and tracking #6
- Computing and quantifying the cell flows within the placozoan #7
- Putting in relation placozoan and wound shape with cell flows #8

You can find the roadmap for the project as an issue [there](https://github.com/CENTURI-Hackathon-2022/placozoan-visualisation/issues/1).

You should try to follow the objectives but the order is not important (though
some milestones are dependent on others).

# Tutorial
The analysis is divided into 3 parts and the corresponding jupyter notebooks should be ran in this order:
- Shape segmentation:  
The shape segmentation (contouring object shape) has been investigated upon three different methods. The first is by training a deep learning network with hand-labelled images. [TO COMPLETE THE OTHER METHODS PLEASE]  
  
  /!\ You should run the "Preprocess_wound.ipynb" notebook with as input the organism segmentation file in order to generate the wound segmentation file. This is necessary for the next steps and to be able to characterize the wound shape.  
  
- Shape description:  
The jupyter notebook "Shape_descriptors.ipynb" imports the original tif and the segmented image (binary tif mask), previously generated, and will compute characteristics of the mask main object. You have to specify whether you want to analyse the entire organism shape or the wound shape (it is two different masks). You also have to specify the characteristics you would like (area, centroid, etc.) that can found in the region props python module. The features will be saved a dataframe as a csv file. The notebook should be run twice if you want to analyse the organism shape and the wound shape, and don't forget to change the file inputs and the output names!  

- Investigate shape data analysis:  
Plot simple shape features and correlated features of organism/wound shapes with the jupyter notebook "Plot_data.ipynb". You just have to import the csv files, generated by the previous steps.
